Some general tips for engaging here on GitHub:

* Register for a free [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup) if you haven't already.
* You can use [GitHub Markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for formatting text and adding images.
* To help mitigate notification spam, please avoid "bumping" issues with no activity. (To vote an issue up or down, use a :thumbsup: or :thumbsdown: reaction.)
* Please avoid pinging members with `@` unless they've previously expressed interest or involvement with that particular issue.
